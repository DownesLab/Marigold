# Marigold: Zebrafish pose tracking made easier

Marigold is a free and open source web app for analyzing zebrafish behavior. It is being developed by Gregory Teicher (gteicher at umass dot edu) in the [Downes Laboratory](https://www.downeslab.org/) at University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Marigold is compatible with a wide range of experimental paradigms, particularly at embryonic and larval stages. As long as each region of interest only contains a single fish, it is likely that Marigold can track it.

Marigold is licensed under the [GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or later. You are currently viewing its source code on GitHub, where we also host the [web app](https://downeslab.github.io/marigold/) itself.

Currently, Marigold should be regarded as **alpha-level software.** That means it is still missing elements of the planned functionality, contains some known bugs, and is likely to also contain unknown bugs. Additionally, it may not be compatible with future versions of itself. Nevertheless, since we've found Marigold useful even in its current state and hope you will too, we've released it as-is while we track down bugs and implement the remaining functionality.

If you use Marigold for your research, please be sure to cite our manuscript:
